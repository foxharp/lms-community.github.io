# Introduction

The Logitech Media Server provides a command-line interface to the players via TCP/IP. After starting the server, commands and queries may be sent by connecting to a specific TCP/IP port. The server will reply echoing the request (for commands) or by returning the requested data (for queries). By default, the server will listen for connections on TCP/IP port 9090. This format is designed for ease of integration into AMX, Crestron and other automation systems.

See [Using the command-line interface](using-the-cli.md) for details.
